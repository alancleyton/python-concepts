# In Python we use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.
name = 'John Doe'

# The value and type can be changed after assignment
name = 34

# Assigning multiple variables
first_name, last_name, age = 'John', 'John', 27
print(first_name) # John
print(last_name) # John
print(age) # 27

# Assigning the same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 35
print(x) # 35
print(y) # 35
print(z) # 35
